# Magnetic-spinners
Amateur Simulation on Spinning magnets in fidget spinner config

Supports up to 6 spinners
Desc:
Time series simulation based on potential energy of magnets
Errors in simulation:
Unable to account for collisions, air resistance, and random sharp interactions(suspected to be due to proximity of spinners being too close which makes it difficult to model)
